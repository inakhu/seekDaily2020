God's instruction for the journey of this year is: 'listen and learn to fear the Lord'. Everyone attends church programmes mainly to hear the Word of God but not all fear the Lord. God told Moses to write down the law and read it to the Israelites. He obeyed but the Israelites disobeyed God's instructions and fell into terrible errors. A journey that could have taken 40days turned to 40years. Most of those who left the land of bondage could not make it to the Promised Land. Lack of fear of God is a major reason people fail in their life journey and cut short their lives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge (Proverbs 1:7; 9:10). Let the fear of God guide your actions this year. Relate with people around you with the fear of God. Let all your transactions and undertakings be done in the fear of God. Do not only listen to the Word of God, learn to fear God and obey His instructions.<\/p>\r\n","insight":"He who fears God need not fear any other thing.","prayer":" Father, let your Holy Spirit envelop me this year that I may live in reverence to God.","rbtpassage":"Genesis 1-4","rbtlink":"https:\/\/www.biblestudytools.com\/passage\/?q=Genesis+1:1-31;+Genesis+2:1-25;+Genesis+3:1-24;+Genesis+4:1-26"},{"id":2,"devotional_date":"Thursday, January 2","text":"2 Chronicles 5:2-7","topic":"ARK BROUGHT TO THE TEMPLE","memoryverse":"'The priests then brought the ark of the Lord's covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place' \u2026 ","memoryversetext":"2 Chronicles 5:7 ","body":"<p>At the completion of the construction of the temple Solomon built for God, the ark of the Lord's covenant was brought to the center of the building.

'Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst?' (1Corinthians 3:16). Anyone who claims to be a Christian without the Holy Spirit controlling his\/her life is like a temple without the ark of covenant. That is, claiming to be alive but without substance. For a meaningful life in the Lord, the Holy Spirit must be allowed into the innermost part of one's life. A Christian life without the Holy Spirit can never be fruitful to God's kingdom. You should be tired of living in the flesh which is not profitable allow the Holy Spirit to indwell your life.

The power of God took over the entire worship atmosphere to the point that the priests could not perform their duty. God Himself took over the worship service.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>How often do we experience the power of God in our worship? We know how to sing in various tunes but the power of God seems to be absent because many worship leaders do not consecrate themselves before their spiritual assignment. Our praises are fruitless today because we lack spiritual quality to draw the power of God. Our God is still the same and His power is available.

The place where we worship must honor our great God. It is a shame to live in a magnificent house and worship God in a deplorable structure.

It is a place people go for personal and corporate prayers. The doors of some church buildings are always opened to allow people have access to God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, our God cannot be confined to a building. Solomon himself confessed of God that, 'The heaven, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!' (v.18). While the church building symbolizes the presence of God, we should be conscious of the fact that God is present everywhere and can be worshiped everywhere. We can offer our prayers to God wherever we find ourselves. When Jacob had an encounter with God, he exclaimed, 'surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it' (Genesis 28:16).

Many people are not taking the church serious again because some churches have become centers of injustice. There is no genuine restoration today because there is no genuine repentance.

Solomon pleaded that God should have mercy on His people and deliver them from the hands of their enemies who might have taken them into captivity. Secondly, he appealed to God to forgive the sin of the people any time they genuinely confess, repent and turn away from their sinful ways. The two reasons are interwoven. Enemies can only succeed over God's people when they fall into sin. No enemy has been able to overcome or conquer the Israelites except when they go astray. Sin first conquers people before the enemies prevail.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Christians are fighting unending battles on mountains, churches and homes today but enemies are victorious because they lack genuine repentance. God answered the prayer of Solomon because any time the people of Israel approached God in genuine repentance; He always delivered them from their enemies. This is a big lesson for us to learn.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you under siege or bondage? Check your relationship with God and approach the throne of grace with a heart of genuine repentance.

He pleaded that God should not forget His great love for His anointed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our God has always been faithful to His promises. In his valedictory speech to the people of Israel, Joshua testified thus, 'Not one of all the Lord's good promises to Israel failed; everyone was fulfilled' (Joshua 21:45). God cannot forget His promises and He will not abandon His people.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eyes of God are always open and His ears are attentive to our prayers (v. 40). Our prayer can also reflect that of Solomon: 'May your priests Lord God, be clothed with salvation, may your faithful people rejoice in your goodness.'

With that inherent liberty, Adam chose to obey Satan's voice in the Garden of Eden, in spite of God's clear instruction.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Moses was winding up his ministry with the Israelites, he took them to Mount Ebal where, according to God's instructions, he rehearsed to them the blessings they will enjoy if they choose to obey Him and curses that will come upon them if they disobey Him. God created man with liberty of choice, but it is a liberty within the sphere of God's commands. The liberty of choice comes with consequences - both negative and positive, blessings and curses depending on each person's choice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not use your liberty to disobey God. The consequences of choosing to disobey are always unbearable, but if you choose to obey God, you will have more than you actually desire or bargain for.

This is because worldly wisdom has no root in God; therefore, it cannot last. True wisdom can only be found in Christ. In fact, the Scriptures refer to Christ as the wisdom of God. In essence, you cannot claim to have the wisdom of God if you do not know Christ. Wisdom is a relationship with the giver, with Wisdom Himself. Do you have a relationship with Wisdom?

Rather than soil his white coat, he does not mind being trapped by dogs and captured while preserving his purity. For the ermine, purity is more precious than life.

He knew God personally and sought Him diligently irrespective of what others did around him. Many people seek God because they are in need. Once their needs are met they will turn their back on God.
